To get good at the basics of JavaScript, and from a guy that _gets_ modesty when it comes to writing JavaScript, check out [Chris Ferdinandi][cferdinandi]. He puts together the Vanilla JS Academy, a cohort-based course on learning JavaScript. He also sells some ebooks, and writes excellent daily articles on writing JavaScript. Also, check out his [_Lean Web_][leanweb] presentation and book.

To help you become a better influencer (leader), I recommend the classic book _[Principle-Centered Leadership][covey]_ by Stephen Covey, at least the first half of the book. You'll learn to disassociate your choices from your skills, and instead center your decisions on bigger-picture principles.

To help examine and rewrite on-the-spot the underlying assumptions/convictions/mental models at play in your mind, I recommend the book _[Leadership Agility][agility]_ by Bill Joiner. Another option is to watch some of the videos from my series on [Changing Situations Using Mental Reprogramming On Yourself][mental-reprogramming].

To help understand what causes people to buy products (and buy into ideas) -- in short, to _sell_ -- I recommend _[Competing Against Luck][jtbd]_ by Clayton Christensen. It's a primer on the Jobs-To-Be-Done Theory of buyer behavior.
