title: JS Project Ideas Once Past Beginner Level
---

Let's say you just finished some beginner-level javascript tutorials and you'd like to learn more. Here's a list of functionalities to pick from. Below the functionalities, you'll fine some extra constraints: approaches, toolchains, syntaxes, and optimizations.

Happy Learning!

## 1. Choose a Functionality

### User Interfaces (UIs)

* Basic Calculator
* Questionnaire
* Multi-range slider field
* Copy to clipboard button
* Side-scrolling game
* Element re-ordering
* HTML5 audio player controls
* A canvas to draw on

### Animations

* Make a box resize on hover
* Add a fade on loading a different part of the page
* Bounce on object inside a box
* Animate a splash animation inside a button on click

### Data Consumption

* Display Weather Data from a public API
* Perform Extract-Transform-Load: Modify data from one form to another
* Update a server via a GraphQL mutation

### DOM Traversal/Manipulation

* Insert an element at the end of a list
* Insert an element at the beginning of a list
* Wrap elements inside a wrapper
* Find an ancestor of an element

### Event Handling

* Perform validation on leaving a field, on changing field content (with delay)
* Upon one page component capturing user input, communicate the change to another component using a custom event handler
* Ensure that an event handler is removed when element is removed from page, re-added when the element is re-added

## 2. Choose an Approach

* Vanilla JS / Native Browser APIs / CSS
* Vue.js SPA (Single-Page Application)
* In-spot Vue.js (just for that section of the page)
* React SPA (Single-Page Application)
* Stimulus JS

## 3. Choose a Toolchain

For transpiling, concatenation and minification.

* No toolchain - Scripts in the footer in global namespace
* Gulp
* Grunt
* Webpack 

## 4. Choose a Syntax

* Common JavaScript
* ES6

## 5. Choose an Optimization

* Minimize JS use (opt for CSS methods, minimize external packages)
* Maximize use of npm packages (don't re-invent the wheel)
* Minimize first-load time

Hope this helps!
